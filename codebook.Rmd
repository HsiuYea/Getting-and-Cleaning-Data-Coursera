Data : Data from Source Data URL downloaded and unzip into Local. Set as working directory in R

Transformation:
1. Read trainings files (X_train.txt, Y_train.txt, subject_train.txt) from "UCI HAR Dataset/train folder" and store them into 1 variable name training
2. Read testing files (X_test.txt, Y_test.txt, subject_test.txt)  from "UCI HAR Dataset/test folder" and store them into 1 variable name testing
3. Read activity labels file (activity_labels.txt) from main "UCI HAR Dataset" folder and store into 1 variable name activityLabels
4. Read features file (features.txt) from main "UCI HAR Dataset" folder and store into 1 variable name features
5. Merges training and test sets into 1 variable name allData
6.  Get the subset of data contain Mean and Std and store into 1 variable name MeanStdData
7. Add 2 new columns - Activity and Subject
8. Assign descriptive name from activity labels to name the activities
9. Labels data set with descriptive variable names
10. Creates a second independent tidy data and write into tidy_data.txt in current working directory
